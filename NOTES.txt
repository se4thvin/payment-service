We'll extend your existing database models to include:
PaymentMethod: Stores tokens for payment methods.
Subscription: Manages user subscriptions and their statuses.
Transaction: Records payment transactions and histories.



I have a webapp which has a 3 tier subscription based payment structure and I want to create a micro-service using python for backend and tsx next.js and react for the frontend. I will have a payment page where the user will be able to enter in payment info including the card number, billing address and such - this information will be taken in the backend using python, we will process our payments using the intuit apis for quickbook payments so this microservice will have a customer facing frontend and a backend service that communicates with the api and processes the said transactions.
